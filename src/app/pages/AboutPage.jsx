            <p className="readable-paragraph">
              Unlike simple automated readings, our AI considers the complex interplay between cards, their positions, and their relationships to astrological influences, creating a multi-dimensional analysis that rivals traditional in-person readings.

          <div className="space-y-6 text-white">
            <p className="readable-paragraph">
              A Tarot reading offers guidance, not definitive futures. The cards reveal energies, patterns, and possibilitiesâ€”not predetermined outcomes. They serve as a mirror, reflecting aspects of your situation you may not consciously recognize.
            </p>
            
            <p className="readable-paragraph">
              As you receive your reading, keep an open mind and reflect on how the insights connect to your life. Sometimes the most valuable aspects of a reading aren't immediately obvious but become clear with reflection.
            </p>
            
            <p className="readable-paragraph">
              Remember that you always possess free will. The cards may illuminate the path, but you choose the steps you take along your journey.
